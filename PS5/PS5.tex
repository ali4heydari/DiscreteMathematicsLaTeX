\section{Connected graph}
Prove the theorem blow.
\begin{theorem}
A graph is connected if and only if for every partition of it's vertices into two nonempty sets, there
is an edge with endpoints in both sets.
\end{theorem}
\begin{shaded}
\begin{answer}
\begin{proof}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Let $G$ is connected. Take an arbitrary partition $V (G) = X \cup Y of V (G)$ into two non-empty sets. We should show that $G$ has an edge with one endpoint in $X$ and the other in $Y$. Select vertices $x$ in $X$, and $y$ in $Y$ . (Possible because $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty.) Because $G$ is connected, there has to be a path in $G$ that joins $x$ to $y$. Denote this path as follows.
$$x = x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots , x_n = y$$
The first vertex $x_0$ of this path is in $X$, and the last vertex $x_n$ is in $Y$ . Any one of the others is either in $X$ or $Y$ . Suppose $i$ be the smallest index for which $x_i \in Y$ . (Such an $i$ exists, because $x_n \in Y$ , so $i$ is at most $n$.) Now we have $x_{i-1} \in X$ and $x_i \in Y$ , so $x_{i-1}x_i$
is an edge of $G$ with one endpoint in $X$ and the other in $Y$ .

$(\Leftarrow)$ Let that for any partition $V (G) = X \cup Y of V (G)$ into two non-empty sets, $G$ has an edge with one endpoint in $X$ and the other in $Y$ . We need to show $G$ is connected. For the sake of contradiction, suppose $G$ is not connected. Let $C$ be one of its components. Now we have a partition
$$V (G) = V (C) \in (V (G) − V (C))$$
 of $V (G)$ into two non-empty sets. By assumption, $G$ has an edge with endpoints in each set in this partition. That is to say $G$ has an edge with one endpoint in one of its components and the other endpoint in another component. Contradiction!

\section{Connected simple $n$-vertex graph}

\begin{theorem}

graph with $l$ vertices of even degree and $m$ vertices of odd degree if and only if $m$ is even,
except for $(l, m, n) = (2, 0, 2)$.

\section{About Graph}
Necessary and sufficient conditions for a list $d$ to be graphic when $d$ consists of $k$ copies of $a$ and $n − k$ copies of $b$, with $a \geq b \geq 0$. Since the degree sum must be even, the quantity $k$ $a + (n − k)b$ must be even. In addition, the inequality $k$ $a \leq k(k − 1) + (n − k)$ $min\{k, b\}$ must hold, since each vertex with degree $b$ has at most $min\{k, b\}$ incident edges whose other endpoint has degree $a$. We construct graphs with the desired degree sequence when these conditions hold. Note that the inequality implies $a \leq n − 1$.

\section{Graph orientation}
Prove the theorem blow.
\begin{theorem}
Every graph $G$ has an orientation such that $|d +(v) - d-(v)| \leq 1$ for all $v$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{shaded}
\begin{answer}
ANSWER HERE.
\end{answer}
\end{shaded}


\section{Strong orientation of a graph}
A strong orientation of a graph that has an odd cycle also has an odd $(directed)$ cycle. Suppose that $D$ is a strong orientation of a graph $G$ that has an odd cycle $v1, \dots , v2k+1$. Since $D$ is strongly connected, for each $i$ there is a $vi, vi+1-path$ in $D$. If for some $i$ every such path has even length, then the edge between $vi$ and $vi+1$ points from $vi+1$ to $vi$, since the other orientation would be a $vi, vi+1-path$ of length 1 $(odd)$. In this case, we have an odd cycle through $vi$ and $vi+1$. Otherwise, we have a path of odd length from each $vi$ to $vi+1$. Combining these gives a closed trail of odd length In a digraph as well as in a graph (by the same proof), a closed odd trail contains the edges of an odd cycle

\section{Certain bridge club}
A certain bridge club has a special rule to the effect that four members may play together only if no two of them have previously partnered one another. At one meeting fourteen members, each of whom has previously partnered five others, turn up. Three games are played, and then proceedings come to a halt because of the club rule. Just as the members are preparing to leave, a new member, unknown to any of them, arrives. Show that at least one more game can now be played.
